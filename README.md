    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
    ```
    or on Windows, download and install PostgreSQL from [the official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

5. Initialize the database using `db_init.sql`:
    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql -f path/to/db_init.sql
    ```
    **Note**: Make sure to edit the `db_init.sql` file to include your own database name, user, and password.

6. Edit the `settings.py` file to include your database configuration:
    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'your_database_name',
            'USER': 'your_database_user',
            'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }
    ```
    5. Initialize the database using `db_init.sql`:

        On Linux:
        ```bash
        sudo -u postgres psql -f path/to/db_init.sql
        ```

        On Windows:
        ```bash
        psql -U postgres -f path\to\db_init.sql
        ```

        **Note**: Make sure to edit the `db_init.sql` file to include your own database name, user, and password.

6. Edit the `settings.py` file to include your database configuration:
    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'your_database_name',
            'USER': 'your_database_user',
            'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }
    ```

7. Apply database migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
8. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
9. For using Stripe API in development mode, you need to create a Stripe developer account. You can sign up at [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

10. Install Stripe cli:

    ```bash
    curl -s https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh
    ```

    or on Windows, download and install the Stripe CLI from [the official website](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install).

11. Log in to the Stripe CLI:
    ```bash
    stripe login
    ```

12. Start the Stripe webhook forwarding:
    ```bash
    stripe listen --forward-to http://127.0.0.1:8000/orders/webhooks/stripe/
    ```

    > **Note**: starting the Stripe webhook forwarding is essential for receiving real-time notifications about events related to your Stripe account, such as successful payments, refunds, and disputes. This allows your application to respond to these events promptly and update the order status accordingly.

13. Modify the Stripe public key, secret key, and webhook key in `settings.py`:
    ```python
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'your_stripe_public_key'
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'your_stripe_secret_key'
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = 'your_stripe_webhook_secret_key'
    ```

    > **Note**: The Stripe public key and secret key are used to authenticate your application with the Stripe API. The webhook secret key is used to verify the authenticity of the events received from Stripe, ensuring that they are not tampered with.

14. Start the development server:
        ```bash

        cd NATURALILY
        python manage.py runserver
        ```
